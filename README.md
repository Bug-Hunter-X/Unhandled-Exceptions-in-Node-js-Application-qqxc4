# Node.js Unhandled Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: inadequate error handling.  The `bug.js` file showcases a server susceptible to crashing silently without providing any useful information to the developer.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle these errors using Node.js's built-in `process` event handlers.
